Instructions

This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.

Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.

Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).

Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.

Solutions

function preFizz(n) {
  // params- n
  // return- loop from input to output
  // example- loop 1 from 5
  // psudo- i need a loop,  
  for (let i = 1; i < n.length; n++){
    }
  return Array.from({length:n},(v,i) => i+1);
}
